# Belly Button Biodiversity with Plotly

## Overview
### We have a good start on an interactive dashboard on our web site for the volunteers that are participating in the study by Improbable Beef. We are going to add some charts to show the cultures found, washing frequency and the bacteria species per sample. This will allow the volunteers to see informative data gathered from their samples.

## Results

## Summary
### We now have an interactive dashboard. Volunteers can go to the web page, select their test subject ID No and see their data displayed. Besides the demograhic information there is now a bar chart showing the top ten bacterica cultures found, a guage chart showing washing frequency and a bubble chart showing the bacteria species per sample.
